# VIPRE - Visualization of the Impact of PRobe Entry conditions on the mission and spacecraft design

A software package consisting of the software tools IPED and VAPRE, to compute (IPED) and visualize (VAPRE) the entry conditions for all safe entry opportunities of a planetary entry probe being released from an interplanetary trajectory. 

It is a prototype and proof of concept on how to compute and display a large amount of trajectory options, and enable the 3D visualization of scientific data for browsing, filtering and optimizing with respect to the maximizing mission return.
